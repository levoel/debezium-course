<objective>
Create the self-assessment checklist lesson for the capstone project (CAP-03).

Purpose: This lesson provides students with a comprehensive production readiness checklist to evaluate their capstone project. It enables self-directed learning and ensures students meet production-grade standards.

Output: One MDX lesson file containing the detailed self-assessment checklist with scoring rubric.

  <action>
Create the final capstone lesson with production readiness checklist.

Frontmatter:
- title: "Production Readiness Checklist"
- description: "Чеклист для самопроверки capstone проекта"
- order: 3
- difficulty: "advanced"
- estimatedTime: 20
- topics: ["Production Readiness", "Self-Assessment", "Checklist", "Quality"]
- prerequisites: ["module-7/02-architecture-deliverables"]

Content structure:
1. Introduction - Why self-assessment matters
   - Production != "it works locally"
   - Four Golden Signals concept (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
   - Checklist as learning tool, not exam

2. Checklist sections (adapted from 11-RESEARCH.md):

   **Section 1: Functionality (Core Pipeline)**
   - [ ] Aurora outbox table created with REPLICA IDENTITY FULL
   - [ ] Debezium connector captures INSERT events from outbox
   - [ ] Outbox Event Router SMT routes to correct Kafka topics
   - [ ] PyFlink job consumes Debezium-formatted events
   - [ ] PyFlink transformations execute correctly
   - [ ] BigQuery table has PRIMARY KEY declaration
   - [ ] End-to-end latency < 5 seconds verified

   **Section 2: Fault Tolerance**
   - [ ] Kafka offsets tracked correctly (connector restart test)
   - [ ] PyFlink checkpoints enabled and completing
   - [ ] Replication slot survives restart without data loss
   - [ ] Duplicate handling implemented (idempotent operations)
   - [ ] Snapshot mode configured appropriately

   **Section 3: Monitoring & Observability**
   - [ ] Prometheus scrapes JMX metrics
   - [ ] Grafana dashboard shows: lag, throughput, status, errors
   - [ ] Alerts configured for critical failures
   - [ ] Four Golden Signals answerable

   **Section 4: Schema Evolution**
   - [ ] Schema Registry configured (if using Avro)
   - [ ] Tested adding new column
   - [ ] Tested removing optional column
   - [ ] PyFlink handles missing fields gracefully

   **Section 5: Operational Readiness**
   - [ ] Runbook documents common failures
   - [ ] Capacity planning documented
   - [ ] DR plan defined
   - [ ] No hardcoded credentials

   **Section 6: Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Source-to-target data validation
   - [ ] Data quality tests (no duplicates, no missing fields)
   - [ ] Negative testing (malformed input handling)
   - [ ] Load testing evidence

   **Section 7: Documentation**
   - [ ] README with setup instructions
   - [ ] Architecture diagram (C4 model)
   - [ ] Runbook with procedures
   - [ ] Known limitations documented

3. Scoring Rubric:
   - Exemplary (90-100%): All sections complete + advanced patterns
   - Above Average (75-89%): All critical sections, minor doc gaps
   - Meets Expectations (60-74%): Core works, monitoring/testing incomplete
   - Below Expectations (<60%): Works locally, lacks production patterns

4. Common Mistakes section (from 11-RESEARCH.md pitfalls):
   - Aurora replication slot exhaustion
   - Missing REPLICA IDENTITY FULL
   - BigQuery primary key issues
   - Snapshot mode misunderstanding
   - Missing idempotency
   - Insufficient monitoring

5. Final encouragement:
   - This checklist represents production best practices
   - Not all items required for every use case
   - Focus on demonstrating understanding, not perfection

Format checklists using markdown checkbox syntax.
Include tips/warnings in blockquote format.
