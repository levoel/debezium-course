<objective>
Push changes to GitHub, configure repository for GitHub Actions deployment, and verify live site

Purpose: Complete the deployment by pushing the updated workflow to GitHub, ensuring the repository is configured to use GitHub Actions as the Pages deployment source, and verifying the live site works correctly.

Output: Live course accessible at https://levoel.github.io/debezium-course/

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Push workflow changes to GitHub</name>
  <files>None (git operations)</files>
  <action>
Push the updated workflow file to the main branch:

1. Stage the workflow file changes
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Push to origin main

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow automatically.

Note: Do NOT commit planning files in this commit - only the workflow file.
  </action>

git status
git log -1 --oneline
# Should show clean working tree after push
# Commit message should mention workflow update

  <done>
Workflow changes pushed to GitHub main branch, triggering automatic deployment

  <name>Task 2: Configure GitHub Pages deployment source</name>
  <action>
The repository must be configured to use GitHub Actions as the deployment source.
This step requires manual configuration in the GitHub web UI.
  </action>
  <instructions>
Please complete the following steps:

1. Open your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/levoel/debezium-course
2. Navigate to **Settings** (gear icon in top menu)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Find the **Source** dropdown
   - Select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
5. Click **Save** if prompted

After configuring:
- The workflow should already be running (triggered by your push)
- If the workflow already completed before you changed settings, click "Run workflow" button to re-trigger

Wait for the workflow to complete (~2 minutes).

  <what-built>
Complete Debezium course deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions workflow.
The site includes:
- 65+ MDX pages with technical content
- Mermaid diagrams with client-side rendering
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Navigation between all modules and lessons
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Please verify the following:

1. **Homepage loads**: Visit https://levoel.github.io/debezium-course/
   - Page should load without 404
   - Styling (Tailwind CSS) should be applied
   - Navigation should be visible

2. **Navigation works**: Click through to any lesson
   - Links should not 404
   - URLs should include `/debezium-course/` base path
   - Back navigation should work

3. **Mermaid diagrams render**: Visit a page with Mermaid (e.g., Module 8 lessons)
   - Diagrams should render as SVG graphics
   - Not showing as raw text or code blocks

4. **Code blocks have syntax highlighting**:
   - Code blocks should have colored syntax
   - Python, YAML, SQL, Java should all highlight correctly

5. **Mobile responsive** (optional):
   - Open in mobile view or resize browser
   - Navigation should be accessible via hamburger menu
  </how-to-verify>
