<objective>
Create the capstone project overview and architecture lessons for Module 7 (Capstone).

Purpose: These lessons define what students will build (CAP-01) and how they should structure their solution (CAP-02). This is the final module of the course, synthesizing all prior learnings into a production-ready CDC pipeline project.

Output: Two MDX lesson files in the new Module 7 directory covering project scope and architecture requirements.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create capstone overview lesson</name>
  <files>src/content/course/07-module-7/01-capstone-overview.mdx</files>
  <action>
Create new directory `src/content/course/07-module-7/` and lesson file.

Frontmatter:
- title: "Capstone: End-to-End CDC Pipeline"
- description: "Проектирование production-ready CDC системы Aurora -> Outbox -> PyFlink -> BigQuery"
- order: 1
- difficulty: "advanced"
- estimatedTime: 30
- topics: ["Capstone", "CDC", "Aurora", "PyFlink", "BigQuery", "Production"]
- prerequisites: ["module-6/06-cloud-monitoring"]

Content structure (Russian explanatory text, English code/config):
1. Introduction - What is the capstone? (synthesis project, not new concepts)
2. Business scenario - E-commerce order processing pipeline
3. Pipeline overview diagram (Mermaid flowchart: Aurora -> Outbox table -> Debezium -> Kafka -> PyFlink -> BigQuery)
4. Technology stack summary table (component, purpose, module reference)
5. What you will build - explicit deliverables list
6. Success criteria - what "done" looks like
7. Time estimate and recommended approach

Use patterns from 11-RESEARCH.md:
- Outbox Event Router SMT configuration example
- PyFlink Table API code example
- BigQuery CDC table creation example

Key points to emphasize:
- This validates ALL prior learnings (Modules 1-6)
- Production readiness is the goal, not just "it works"
- Monitoring and documentation are first-class deliverables

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create architecture and deliverables lesson</name>
  <files>src/content/course/07-module-7/02-architecture-deliverables.mdx</files>
  <action>
Create second capstone lesson covering architecture requirements and deliverables.

Frontmatter:
- title: "Архитектура и Deliverables"
- description: "Требования к архитектуре capstone проекта и список deliverables"
- order: 2
- difficulty: "advanced"
- estimatedTime: 40
- topics: ["Architecture", "Production", "Documentation", "Monitoring"]
- prerequisites: ["module-7/01-capstone-overview"]

Content structure:
1. Project structure - recommended directory layout (from 11-RESEARCH.md)
2. Component architecture diagrams:
   - System context (C4 Level 1) - users and external systems
   - Container diagram (C4 Level 2) - main components
3. Technical requirements by component:
   - Aurora/PostgreSQL: outbox table, replication settings
   - Debezium: connector config with Outbox Event Router SMT
   - PyFlink: Table API job structure, checkpointing
   - BigQuery: CDC table with primary keys
   - Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
4. Deliverables checklist (what to submit):
   - Working code (infrastructure, PyFlink job, BigQuery DDL)
   - Documentation (README, architecture.md, runbook.md)
   - Monitoring (dashboards, alerts)
   - Testing evidence (screenshots, logs)
5. Anti-patterns to avoid (from 11-RESEARCH.md Common Pitfalls)
6. Production patterns to follow

Include code examples:
- Debezium connector JSON config (from research)
- PyFlink job skeleton (from research)
- BigQuery table DDL (from research)
- Project structure tree diagram

After both tasks complete:
1. New directory exists: `ls -la src/content/course/07-module-7/`
2. Both lessons have valid frontmatter
3. Lesson 2 references lesson 1 in prerequisites
4. Mermaid diagrams render (verified by chart syntax)
5. Code blocks have language tags
6. Content follows Russian text / English code pattern
